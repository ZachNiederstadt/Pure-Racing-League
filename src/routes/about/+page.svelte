		Founded in April 2023 by Street Version, Pure Racing GT was born from a simple yet powerful
		vision: to create a space where racing is stripped down to its purest form â€“ no complicated
		rules, no questionable steward decisions, just pure competition and the thrill of the race.

	<h1 class="flex justify-center p-5 font-orbitron text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400">
		Top Level Competition
	</h1>
	<p class="font-ubuntu p-12 text-center tracking-wider">
		From day one, we've hosted top-tier talent, including over seven Gran Turismo World Series
		drivers in our inaugural season alone. With three additional drivers who've participated in USA
		Porsche Esports Challenge live events. This level of competition speaks volumes about the
		quality and integrity of our league.
